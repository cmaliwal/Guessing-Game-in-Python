# Guessing-Game-in-Python
This script is an interactive guessing game, which will ask the user to guess a number between 1 and 20 in 6 attempt.   We are using the random module with the randint function to get a random number.   The script also contains a while loop, which make the script run until the user guess the right number (only on 6 attempts).
